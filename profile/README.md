# Brick ðŸ§±

Hi ðŸ¤™

### What is Brick?
We are helping the largest insurers to build AI agents.

We help them to automate underwriting and claims management by interacting with powerful agents that organize their knowledge base, build great decision oriented workflows and generate powerful insights. 

We do that by usign the best tools to solve each of one of those problems.

### Our Stack

- We use React with typescript, React Query and Tailwind CSS.

- We use NestJS with typescript, CQRS and Postgres as our main backend.

- We use Google BigQuery as our DataWarehouse.

- We use AWS as our main cloud provider.

### How we do things

- We are intense. If we crash, we might as well do it at 400 km/h.

- We are crazy and weird.

- We are problem solvers, not problem seekers.

- We support each other. Nothing huge is made by one single person.

- We are obsessed, especially with our customers.

- We believe that life is a daring adventure or nothing at all.


### We are building the future of insurance, **brick by brick**
